Hello! I am Kendall Coleman and this is my portfolio.

Kendalls Portfolio was created to present myself and my work to potential employers.

This project was fun but rough as it may have took me a lot longer than others to do. In the beginning I didn't know what I was doing so doing a lot of research and reading is what got me through this project, along with the help of my tutor and TA's. 

When an employer visits my portfolio, they will be able to learn about who I am as an individual, links to past projects, my resume, and my contact information. 

In the begining of the body I used a <nav> tag to create the navbar with 2 <div> tags for the logo and container. The unordered list <ul> of items includes list items <li> 'About Me', 'Projects', 'Resume', and 'Contacts'. Each <li> has an anchor <a> tag with a href #link that will smoothly scroll to each <li> on the page.

The second half of the body I created a <header> tag with 2 <div> tags for the the container that holds everything within the header and the title, the title also has an <h1> tag. Then i used an <img> tag for the Chicago Skyline image that is above the title and under the navbar.

Within the <section> there is 4 <h2> tags with the title of each section 'About Me', 'Projects', 'Resume', and 'Contacts'. There are 4 <div> tags with a class of box and an id that targets the title. A hashtag is used when referring to the id attribute, so when adding #AboutMe to the href in the <nav> it will create a link to the 'About Me' section instead of a URL.

In the 'About Me' section I added 3 <img> tags within a <div> to display 3 images that currently represents me. Under that will be a <p> tag to allow me to write about myself.
