# Kendalls Portfolio 

Kendalls Portfolio was created to present myself and my work to potential employers.

This project was fun but rough as it may have took me a lot longer than others to do. In the beginning I didn't know what I was doing so doing a lot of research and reading is what got me through this project, along with the help of my tutor and TA's. 

When an employer visits my portfolio, they will be able to learn about who I am as an individual, links to past projects, my resume, and my contact information. 

In the begining of the body I used a <nav> tag to create the navbar with 2 <div> tags for the logo and container. The unordered list <ul> of items includes list items <li> 'About Me', 'Projects', 'Resume', and 'Contacts'. Each <li> has an anchor <a> tag with a href #link that will smoothly scroll to each section on the page.

The second half of the body I created a <header> tag 

I used scroll behavior To get to each section wiithout manually scrolling, I linked each section to the navigation bar which will smoothly scroll to each of them.
